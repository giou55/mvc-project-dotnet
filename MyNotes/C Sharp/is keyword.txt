The is keyword performs a type check and, if a value is of the specified type, 
will assign the value to a new variable.

This expression evaluates as true if the value stored in data[i] is a decimal. 
The value of data[i] will be assigned to the variable d, which allows it to be 
used in subsequent statements without needing to perform any type conversions. 
The is keyword will match only the specified type, which means that only
two of the values in the data array will be processed (the other items in the 
array are string and int values).
