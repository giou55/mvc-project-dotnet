Null-Forgiving Operator (!)

The null-forgiving operator is an exclamation mark and is used in this example to tell 
the compiler that products[0] isn’t null, even though null state analysis has identified 
that it might be.

When using the ! operator, you are telling the compiler that you have better insight into 
whether a variable can be null, and, naturally, this should be done only when you are 
entirely confident that you are right.

public ViewResult Index() {
	Product?[] products = Product.GetProducts();
	return View(new string[] { products[0]!.Name });
}
