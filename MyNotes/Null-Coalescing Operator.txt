Null-Coalescing Operator (??)

The null-coalescing operator is two question mark characters (??) and is used to provide a fallback value,
often used in conjunction with the null conditional operator:

public ViewResult Index() {
    Product?[] products = Product.GetProducts();
    return View(new string[] { products[0]?.Name ?? "No Value" });
}

The ?? operator returns the value of its left-hand operand if it isn’t null. 
If the left-hand operand is null, then the ?? operator returns the value of its right-hand operand. 

This behavior works well with the null conditional operator (?). 
If products[0] is null, then the ? operator will return null, and the ?? operator will
return "No Value". 
If products[0] isn’t null, then the result will be the value of its Name property.
